We ran our initial tech radar sessions in October and November 2022 based on the [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), using it as a way for our software teams to share perspectives on a range of tools, techniques and technologies that we use now, that interest us, and that we want to move away from. We followed this with a second run of tech radar sessions during June-August 2023.

We've stuck to Thoughtworks' metaphor with little adaptation for this first pass. We used the same rings, _hold_, _assess_, _trial_ and _adopt_, and found it useful to frame their definitions with, "_If we started a new project today, how would we view this blip?_" Here are the definitions we worked with:

* **Hold**: Proceed with caution; phase out or wait to mature.
* **Assess**: Things we believe are promising and worth exploring.
* **Trial**: Weâ€™ve seen this used in production and recommend it.
* **Adopt**: The single best choice for a given use case.

We also kept the original quadrants, _techniques_, _tools_, _languages & frameworks_ and _platforms_.
