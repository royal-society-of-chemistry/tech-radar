# Royal Society of Chemistry Technology Radar
We ran our initial tech radar sessions in October and November 2022 based on the [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), using it as a way for our software teams to share perspectives on a range of tools, techniques and technologies that we use now, that interest us, and that we want to move away from.

We've stuck to Thoughtworks' metaphor with little adaptation for this first pass. We used the same rings, _hold_, _assess_, _trial_ and _adopt_, and found it useful to frame their definitions with, "_If we started a new project today, how would we view this blip?_" Here are the definitions we worked with:

| | |
| - | - |
| **Hold** | Proceed with caution; phase out or wait to mature. |
| **Assess** | Things we believe are promising and worth exploring. |
| **Trial** | Weâ€™ve seen this used in production and recommend it. |
| **Adopt** | The single best choice for a given use case. |

We also kept the original quadrants, _techniques_, _tools_, _languages & frameworks_ and _platforms_.
